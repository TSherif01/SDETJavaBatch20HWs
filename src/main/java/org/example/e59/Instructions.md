# Exercise 59: Print Years Using For Loop

## Objective
Learn how to use the `for` loop in Java to iterate and print a string along with years within a specific range.

## Instructions

**Print Years Using For Loop**

In this project, you will write a small program that prints the string "Hey, it is year: " followed by the years between 2011 and 2019, including 2019.

**For you to do:**

1. **Initialize the Loop**
    - Use a `for` loop that starts with `year` equal to 2011 and increments `year` by 1 each iteration.

2. **Use the For Loop to Print the String and Year**
    - Ensure the loop continues as long as `year` is less than or equal to 2019.
    - Inside the loop:
        - Print "Hey, it is year:".
        - Print the value of `year`.

## Expected Output
```
Hey, it is year:
2011
Hey, it is year:
2012
Hey, it is year:
2013
Hey, it is year:
2014
Hey, it is year:
2015
Hey, it is year:
2016
Hey, it is year:
2017
Hey, it is year:
2018
Hey, it is year:
2019
```

## Tips
- Ensure your `for` loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to increment the `year` variable by 1 to ensure the loop terminates correctly.

## Additional Information
- **For Loop**: A `for` loop repeatedly executes a block of statements a specified number of times.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop condition and the increment statement are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `for` loop in Java. Happy coding!
