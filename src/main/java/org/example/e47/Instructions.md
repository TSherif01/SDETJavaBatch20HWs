# Exercise 47: Print Numbers in Reverse Using While Loop

## Objective
Learn how to use the `while` loop in Java to iterate and print numbers in reverse.

## Instructions

**Print Numbers in Reverse Using While Loop**

In this project, you will write a small program that prints the numbers from 15 to 0 using a `while` loop.

**For you to do:**

1. **Initialize the Loop Counter**
    - Declare an integer variable called `counter` and set it to 15.

2. **Use a While Loop to Print Numbers in Reverse**
    - Create a `while` loop that continues as long as `counter` is greater than or equal to 0.
    - Inside the loop, print the value of `counter`.
    - Decrement the value of `counter` by 1 after each iteration.

## Expected Output
```
15
14
13
12
11
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
0
```

## Tips
- Ensure your `while` loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to decrement the `counter` inside the loop to ensure the loop terminates correctly.

## Additional Information
- **While Loop**: A `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of statements as long as a specified condition is true.
- **Loop Counter**: A variable used to control the number of times the loop executes.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop condition and the decrement statement are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `while` loop in Java. Happy coding!
