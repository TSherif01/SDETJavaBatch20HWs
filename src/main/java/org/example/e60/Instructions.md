# Exercise 60: Countdown Using For Loop

## Objective
Learn how to use the `for` loop in Java to iterate and print a countdown.

## Instructions

**Countdown Using For Loop**

In this project, you will write a small program that prints the countdown from 10 up to 1 and then says "Happy New Year!".

**For you to do:**

1. **Initialize the Loop**
    - Use a `for` loop that starts with `i` equal to 10 and decrements `i` by 1 each iteration.

2. **Use the For Loop to Print the Countdown**
    - Ensure the loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 1.
    - Inside the loop:
        - Print the value of `i`.

3. **Print Happy New Year Message**
    - After the loop, print "Happy New Year!".

## Expected Output
```
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
Happy New Year!
```

## Tips
- Ensure your `for` loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to decrement the `i` variable by 1 to ensure the loop terminates correctly.

## Additional Information
- **For Loop**: A `for` loop repeatedly executes a block of statements a specified number of times.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop condition and the decrement statement are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `for` loop in Java. Happy coding!
