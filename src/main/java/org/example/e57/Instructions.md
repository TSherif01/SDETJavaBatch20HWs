# Exercise 57: Print Odd Numbers Using For Loop

## Objective
Learn how to use the `for` loop in Java to iterate and print odd numbers within a specific range.

## Instructions

**Print Odd Numbers Using For Loop**

In this project, you will write a small program that prints odd numbers from 5 to 21 using a `for` loop.

**For you to do:**

1. **Initialize the Loop**
    - Use a `for` loop that starts with `i` equal to 5 and increments `i` by 2 each iteration.

2. **Use the For Loop to Print Odd Numbers**
    - Ensure the loop continues as long as `i` is less than 22.
    - Inside the loop:
        - Print the value of `i`.

## Expected Output
```
5
7
9
11
13
15
17
19
21
```

## Tips
- Ensure your `for` loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to increment the `i` variable by 2 to ensure only odd numbers are printed.

## Additional Information
- **For Loop**: A `for` loop repeatedly executes a block of statements a specified number of times.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop condition and the increment statement are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `for` loop in Java. Happy coding!
