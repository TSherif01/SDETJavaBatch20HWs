# Exercise 61: Multiplication Table Using For Loop

## Objective
Learn how to use the `for` loop in Java to iterate and print a multiplication table.

## Instructions

**Multiplication Table Using For Loop**

In this project, you will write a small program that prints the multiplication table of the number 3 from 1 to 10.

**For you to do:**

1. **Initialize the Loop**
    - Use a `for` loop that starts with `i` equal to 1 and increments `i` by 1 each iteration.

2. **Use the For Loop to Print the Multiplication Table**
    - Ensure the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10.
    - Inside the loop:
        - Print the multiplication of 3 and `i` in the format "3*i=result".

## Expected Output
```
3*1=3
3*2=6
3*3=9
3*4=12
3*5=15
3*6=18
3*7=21
3*8=24
3*9=27
3*10=30
```

## Tips
- Ensure your `for` loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to increment the `i` variable by 1 to ensure the loop terminates correctly.

## Additional Information
- **For Loop**: A `for` loop repeatedly executes a block of statements a specified number of times.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop condition and the multiplication statement are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `for` loop in Java. Happy coding!
