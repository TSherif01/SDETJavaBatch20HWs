# Exercise 59: Print Customer Orders Using For Loop

## Objective
Learn how to use the `for` loop in Java to iterate and print a list of customer orders.

## Instructions

**Print Customer Orders Using For Loop**

In this project, you will write a small program that prints a list of customer orders. Assume you have 5 orders to print.

**For you to do:**

1. **Initialize the Loop**
    - Use a `for` loop that starts with `i` equal to 1 and increments `i` by 1 each iteration.

2. **Use the For Loop to Print Customer Orders**
    - Ensure the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 5.
    - Inside the loop:
        - Print "Processing order #" followed by the value of `i`.

## Expected Output
```
Processing order #1
Processing order #2
Processing order #3
Processing order #4
Processing order #5
```

## Tips
- Ensure your `for` loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to increment the `i` variable by 1 to ensure the loop terminates correctly.

## Additional Information
- **For Loop**: A `for` loop repeatedly executes a block of statements a specified number of times.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop condition and the increment statement are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `for` loop in Java. Happy coding!
