# Exercise 48: Print Even Numbers Using While Loop

## Objective
Learn how to use the `while` loop in Java to iterate and print even numbers.

## Instructions

**Print Even Numbers Using While Loop**

In this project, you will write a small program that prints the even numbers from 1 to 13 using a `while` loop.

**For you to do:**

1. **Initialize the Loop Counter**
    - Declare an integer variable called `counter` and set it to 1.

2. **Use a While Loop to Print Even Numbers**
    - Create a `while` loop that continues as long as `counter` is less than or equal to 13.
    - Inside the loop, use an `if` statement to check if `counter` is even.
    - If `counter` is even, print the value of `counter`.
    - Increment the value of `counter` by 1 after each iteration.

## Expected Output
```
2
4
6
8
10
12
```

## Tips
- Ensure your `while` loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to increment the `counter` inside the loop to ensure the loop terminates correctly.
- Use the modulus operator `%` to check if a number is even.

## Additional Information
- **While Loop**: A `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of statements as long as a specified condition is true.
- **Loop Counter**: A variable used to control the number of times the loop executes.
- **Modulus Operator**: The modulus operator `%` returns the remainder of a division operation, which can be used to check if a number is even or odd.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop condition and the increment statement are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `while` loop in Java. Happy coding!
