# Exercise 50: Print Sequence of Numbers Using While Loop

## Objective
Learn how to use the `while` loop in Java to iterate and print a sequence of numbers.

## Instructions

**Print Sequence of Numbers Using While Loop**

In this project, you will write a small program that prints a sequence of numbers starting from 7 to 98, increasing by 7 each time, using a `while` loop.

**For you to do:**

1. **Initialize the Loop Counter**
    - Declare an integer variable called `i` and set it to 7.

2. **Use a While Loop to Print the Sequence**
    - Create a `while` loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 98.
    - Inside the loop, print the value of `i`.
    - Increment the value of `i` by 7 after each iteration.

## Expected Output
```
7
14
21
28
35
42
49
56
63
70
77
84
91
98
```

## Tips
- Ensure your `while` loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to increment the `i` variable inside the loop to ensure the loop terminates correctly.

## Additional Information
- **While Loop**: A `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of statements as long as a specified condition is true.
- **Loop Counter**: A variable used to control the number of times the loop executes.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop condition and the increment statement are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `while` loop in Java. Happy coding!
