# Exercise 62: Print Numbers Except 5 and 6 Using For Loop

## Objective
Learn how to use the `for` loop in Java to iterate and print numbers within a specific range, excluding certain numbers.

## Instructions

**Print Numbers Except 5 and 6 Using For Loop**

In this project, you will write a small program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10 except for 5 and 6.

**For you to do:**

1. **Initialize the Loop**
    - Use a `for` loop that starts with `i` equal to 1 and increments `i` by 1 each iteration.

2. **Use the For Loop to Print the Numbers**
    - Ensure the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10.
    - Inside the loop:
        - Use an `if` statement to skip the numbers 5 and 6.
        - Print the value of `i` if it is not 5 or 6.

## Expected Output
```
1
2
3
4
7
8
9
10
```

## Tips
- Ensure your `for` loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to increment the `i` variable by 1 to ensure the loop terminates correctly.
- Use an `if` statement inside the loop to skip printing the numbers 5 and 6.

## Additional Information
- **For Loop**: A `for` loop repeatedly executes a block of statements a specified number of times.
- **If Statement**: An `if` statement can be used to conditionally execute a block of code.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop condition, increment statement, and `if` statement are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `for` loop and `if` statement in Java. Happy coding!
