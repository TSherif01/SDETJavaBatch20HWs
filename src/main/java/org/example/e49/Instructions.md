# Exercise 49: Repeating Customer Order Confirmation Using While Loop

## Objective
Learn how to use the `while` loop in Java to iterate and repeat a task multiple times.

## Instructions

**Repeating Customer Order Confirmation Using While Loop**

In this project, you will write a small program that confirms a customer's order three times using a `while` loop. This could be useful in a scenario where you need to ensure that the customer acknowledges the order details multiple times for confirmation.

**For you to do:**

1. **Initialize the Loop Counter**
   - Declare an integer variable called `counter` and set it to 0.

2. **Use a While Loop to Repeat Order Confirmation**
   - Create a `while` loop that continues as long as `counter` is less than 3.
   - Inside the loop, print "Please confirm your order: Your order number is 12345".
   - Increment the value of `counter` by 1 after each iteration.

## Expected Output
```
Please confirm your order: Your order number is 12345
Please confirm your order: Your order number is 12345
Please confirm your order: Your order number is 12345
```

## Tips
- Ensure your `while` loop has the correct condition to avoid infinite loops.
- Remember to increment the `counter` inside the loop to ensure the loop terminates correctly.

## Additional Information
- **While Loop**: A `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of statements as long as a specified condition is true.
- **Loop Counter**: A variable used to control the number of times the loop executes.

## Troubleshooting
- If your program doesn't compile, check for syntax errors such as missing semicolons or incorrect variable declarations.
- If the output is not as expected, ensure that the loop condition and the increment statement are correct.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully complete the exercise and understand how to use the `while` loop in Java. Happy coding!
